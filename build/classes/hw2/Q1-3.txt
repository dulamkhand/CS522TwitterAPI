Q1) Traditional Query/Reporting obtains existing raw data with simple query from database. 
   Data Mining obtains data from by discovering pattern and collecting information from data sets.

Q2) Predictive data mining task creates prediction for future data based on existing data Descriptive data mining task finds 
   human interpretable patterns that describes the data Classification - Predictive. Because it takes some part of data 
   (training set) and analyzes it then creates prediction for remaining data. Then it compares to old data to look how 
   accuracy the prediction is. Clustering - Descriptive. Because it finds similarities between data and make group of them 
   and cluster them. Association rule mining - Descriptive. Because it finds associations between data and creates rules of
   dependency. Sequential rule mining - Descriptive. It finds sequences between data. And creates rules of strong sequential 
   dependency. Deviation detection - Predictive. It takes data and predicts if it's going to be in same pattern. 
   But if next data is different it detects it.

Q3) Download dataset from WEKA dataset link, and perform classification or clustering task on it using WEKA, explain following with screen shots:
    a) Basic properties of dataset used and purpose of task? 
		?
    b) # of Attributes, there type (Continuous, Discrete) and Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, ratio?

    c) What technique and algorithm you applied on your dataset e.g Classification-> Trees->REPTree?
            Classification -> trees -> J48

    d) Describe your results in term of instances used? Correctly placed, incorrectly placed, confusion matrix?
            Correctly Classified Instances         168               81.9512 %
            Incorrectly Classified Instances        37               18.0488 %

            === Confusion Matrix ===
